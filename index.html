<p>Currently I work on Purdue University's largest and most poewrful computers, used
by researchers across the university and the globe to move science forward. Even so, my
personal career is focused more in microcontrollers, FPGAs, Embeeded systems, etc. I have
done work on everything from small IoT Devices to huge, fully-automated DevOps projects,
with some software development projects along the way. </p>
